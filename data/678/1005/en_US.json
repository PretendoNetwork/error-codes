			"short_description": "Could not find a clean version of Miiverse applet or recovery files",
			"long_description": "***Note:*** This error relates to the Martini patches, which are now deprecated.\n\nThe patcher could not find an unmodified copy of the Miiverse applet. Either you have manually modified it, it has become corrupted, or you have a version too old or too new for the patcher to recognise.",
			"short_solution": "See support page",
			"long_solution": "- If you are on a system version older than 5.1.0, perform a system update, install [Tiramisu or Aroma](https://wiiu.hacks.guide), and try again.\n- Try disabling any content replacement plugins (SDCafiine etc.) that can change which files are read by the patcher.\n- If you have manually modified your Miiverse applet, reinstall a clean copy from a backup. Instructions for this cannot be provided by Pretendo.\n\nIf all of these failed, get in touch on our [Discord](https://invite.gg/pretendo).",
