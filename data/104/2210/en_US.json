			"long_solution": "- Review the [Wii U installation guide](https://pretendo.network/docs/install/wiiu). Ensure that you have installed [Nimble](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Nimble) and that the Aroma environment it is installed in is set to auto-boot. Otherwise Nimble may not start in time to patch the policylist request, and all BOSS data will fail to download.\n- If Nimble is installed and working, delete your games shared save data. This data typically contains the downloaded SpotPass content, triggering it to be redownloaded",
